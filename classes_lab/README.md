# ES6 Classes Lab

Complete this lab after the [ES6 Classes lecture](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-delorean/LECTURE_U03_D01_ES6-Classes)

Practice ES6 by creating shape classes.

`Shape` is at the top of the class hierarchy.  `Triangle` and `Rectangle` inherit directly from `Shape`.  `Square` inherits directly from `Rectangle`.

Get the tests to pass by editing the `src` files in the following order:

* `shape.js`
* `triangle.js`
* `rectangle.js`
* `square.js`


Use the code comments and tests to guide you. Run them in Chrome. (`test/runner.html`)

Do **NOT** edit the test files.
